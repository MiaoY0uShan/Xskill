For a small clear change, the agent should produce:

- 3-5 line brief
- validation result

For a medium task, the agent should produce:

- Execution Brief
- Evidence Ledger

For a large, vague, architectural, or risky task, the agent should produce:

- Idea Cards or requirements clarification
- delete-scope / architecture / optimize-path only as needed
- compact Execution Brief
- Evidence Ledger
