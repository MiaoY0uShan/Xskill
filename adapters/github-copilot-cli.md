# Xskill adapter: github-copilot-cli

Xskill is agent-agnostic.

## Default behavior

Proactively activate Xskill for coding work, then choose the lightest evidence-backed path.

- **Small change:** Generate a 3-5 line brief and capture the validation result.
- **Medium task:** Create a compact Execution Brief, run verification, and produce an Evidence Ledger.
- **Large, vague, architectural, or risky task:** Use Idea Cards or the full chain before compiling an Execution Brief.
- **Failed task:** Split smaller instead of retrying the same large task.
- **Protocol or agent-behavior change:** Confirm intent and boundaries before editing.

## Rules

- Check `xskill/lessons-learned/` before planning.
- State what to read, what to touch, and how to verify before editing.
- No evidence, no done.
